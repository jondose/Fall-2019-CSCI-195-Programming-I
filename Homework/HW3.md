## Q1: Declare two string variables, join them together and print the result (10 points)
## Q2: Use a for loop to print all the characters in a string(one character in one iteraration) (10 points)
## Q3: Declare one string that consists of at least 10 characters, then print the first character, print the last character, print the 6th character, print from the first to the 4th characters, print from the second to the the second to last.
(30 points)
## Q4: Add your code to the CaesarEncrypt() function in the [slides](https://github.com/ZhangNingSAU/Fall-2019-CSCI-195-Programming-I/blob/master/Lectures/Chapter3.ipynb) to deal with the upper case letters ('A'<=ch<='Z'), and define the CaesarDecrypt(cypherText, n) function to return the plainText.
(50 points)

## Note that: you also need to write some test code for functions in Q4.

## Step 1: write all the code in one single **python file** or **jupyter notebook file**, 
##   name it as the requirments (CSCI195_Homework3_JohnSmith(01234567).py or CSCI195_Homework3_JohnSmith(01234567).ipynb, where 01234567 is your Beecard number).
## Step 2: submit this file on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.sau.edu)
